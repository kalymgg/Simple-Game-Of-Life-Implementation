# Simple Game Of Life Implementation

Probably one of the simpliest Game Of Life implementations written in Python.  Only console mode. Graphics/controlls not included.  
Just run and observe.  
  
You can run with the default settings:
~~~batch
python3 main.py
~~~
Or provide some values:  
size - playground square size. Default - 50. (integer)  
croudness - initial cell population in percents. Default - 10. (intager, range: 0 - 100)  
~~~batch
python3 main.py 50 10
~~~
